# Before/After Comparison of Ongoing Deforestation

A before/after comparison showing ongoing deforestation between May 2018 and May 2020 in my home region. The deforestation occured due to the massive infastation of bark beetles killing most spruce trees in this region.

Imagery taken with "Dove" satellites, taken from [Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/).
