# Bark Beetle Infestation

## Harz

Ongoing massive bark beetle infestation in the *Harz* area in Germany caused the death of many spruce and started reforestation in this region.

The below figure shows a comparison of the region between April 2018 and May 2021. Most change can be seen in in the center of the scene, near the water reservoir *Rappbodetalsperre* in the *Oberharz* region, where brown areas could indicate dead or felled trees / cleared vegetation.
