## Oberharz

A more detailed view of the center region, the *Oberharz*. The difference in color (green before to brown afterwards) and the later time of year in the second scene (April versus May) could indicate that the trees either dried up or were cleared out. This can also be seen in the top left of the view, where dried up trees seem to be of a darker brown tone, while cleared areas seem to be of a brighter brown tone.
